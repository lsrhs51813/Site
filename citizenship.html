<P class="big"> The common misconception of the english bulldog is that they are viscous; however, they are actually really friendly unless trained otherwise.
In fact, the English bulldog is actually a great family dog and they are friednly with children.</p>
<p> 4. Bernese Mountain Dog </p>

<p class="big"> Bernese Mountain Dogs are great family dogs. They are sweet, affectionate, patient if you have a small child climbing on them, and are friendly to strangers and their dogs.
  Be aware though that they think they are lap dogs.
  <p> 3. Newfoundlands </p>

  <p class="big"> Newfoundlands are quite big dogs, the average female weighs 99-120lbs and the average male weighs between 130-150lbs. Although I wouldn't let their size decieve you, they can be considered as the epitomy of a social dog and are extremly loyal dogs who are also being very affectionate.</p>
  <p> 2. Australian Labradoodle </p>
